# hows-the-weather

This is an app to help you see the weather for any location! Just type whatever city you would like to see the current weather for, hit search and the current weather will appear!
This will show the current temperature, wind speed and humidity. I worked with the OpenWeatherMap API for this project! I have run into many issues and am currently having a problem displaying the 5 day forecast out to the screen. When you search a city it will also save your search on the screen so that you do not have to keep typing in the same city! The citys that are saved should be displayed as a cickable button that when you click on brings up the weather for that city! This project was done for week 6 of my coding bootcamp. 


here is a link to the deployed application so you can try it for yourself!
